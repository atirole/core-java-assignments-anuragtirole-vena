Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language and platform used to develop a wide range of applications,
from web and mobile apps to enterprise software and more. It's known for its platform independence,
meaning code written in Java can run on any device or operating system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.
Java's popularity stems from its ease of use, security, and the extensive libraries and frameworks available for developers.
